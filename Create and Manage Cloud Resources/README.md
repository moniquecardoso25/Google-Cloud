# Chalenge Scenario - Lab

You've taken on the role of a Junior Cloud Engineer at Jooli, where your responsibilities include managing the company's infrastructure. This involves tasks like provisioning resources for projects.

In order to excel in this role, you're expected to possess the necessary skills and knowledge. Detailed, step-by-step guides won't be provided, so you should be adept at carrying out these tasks independently.

Jooli company has set specific standards that you should adhere to:

1. Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless instructed otherwise.
2. Follow the naming convention of team-resource. For instance, an instance could be named ***nucleus-webserver1***.
3. Opt for cost-effective resource sizes. Remember that projects are under constant monitoring, and using excessive resources may lead to the termination of the entire project (and potentially your own role). To avoid this, plan your resource allocation thoughtfully. As a guideline, unless otherwise specified, use ***e2-micro*** for small Linux VMs, and opt for e2-medium for applications like Windows or Kubernetes nodes.

## Task 1. Create a project jumphost instance

Requirements:
- Name the instance Instance name.
- Use an e2-micro machine type.
- Use the default image type (Debian Linux).
