# Build and Deploy Machine Learning Solutions on Vertex AI

## Master Vertex AI with High-Impact ML Projects

This Skill Badge is your passport to mastering Vertex AI, Google's unified platform for building and deploying powerful machine learning (ML) models that solve real-world business problems.

### 1 - Identify Damaged Car Parts with Vertex AutoML Vision:

Vertex AI brings together the Google Cloud services for building ML under one, unified UI and API. In Vertex AI, you can now easily train and compare models using AutoML or custom code training and all your models are stored in one central model repository. These models can now be deployed to the same endpoints on Vertex AI.

AutoML Vision helps anyone with limited Machine Learning (ML) expertise train high quality image classification models. In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to produce a custom ML model that automatically recognizes damaged car parts. Since the time it takes to train the model is above the time limit of the lab, you will interact and request predictions from a hosted model in a different project trained on the same dataset. You will then tweak the values of the data for the prediction request and examine how it changes the resulting prediction from the model

**Objectives**

- Upload a labeled dataset to Cloud Storage using a CSV file and connect it to Vertex AI as a Managed Dataset
- Inspect uploaded images to ensure there are no errors in your dataset
- Kick off an AutoML Vision model training job
- Request predictions from a hosted model trained on the same datase

### 2 - Deploy a BigQuery ML Customer Churn Classifier to Vertex AI for Online Predictions
